            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>📚 Welcome!</strong> This guide will help you understand digital certificates, how they work, and how to use the tools provided in this application.

            <h2>🔍 What is a Digital Certificate?</h2>
            <p>A digital certificate is an electronic document that proves the ownership of a public key. It's like a digital passport that establishes your identity in the online world. Certificates are fundamental to secure communication over the internet.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Components of a Certificate:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Subject Information:</strong> Details about the certificate owner (Common Name, Organization, Country, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Public Key:</strong> The cryptographic key used for encryption and authentication</li>
                <li><strong>Issuer Information:</strong> Details about the Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the certificate</li>
                <li><strong>Validity Period:</strong> Start and expiration dates defining when the certificate is valid</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Signature:</strong> The CA's signature proving the certificate's authenticity</li>
                <li><strong>Serial Number:</strong> A unique identifier for the certificate</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>🔐 What is a CSR (Certificate Signing Request)?</h2>
            <p>A CSR is a block of encoded text that you give to a Certificate Authority when applying for an SSL/TLS certificate. It contains information about your organization and the public key that will be included in your certificate.</p>

            </div>
            
            <h3>What's in a CSR?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Common Name (CN):</strong> The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or service name</li>
                <li><strong>Organization (O):</strong> Legal name of your organization</li>
                <li><strong>Organizational Unit (OU):</strong> Department or division name</li>
                <li><strong>Country (C):</strong> Two-letter country code (e.g., NL, US)</li>
                <li><strong>State/Province (ST):</strong> Full name of the state or province</li>
                <li><strong>Locality (L):</strong> City name</li>
                <li><strong>Email:</strong> Contact email address</li>
                <li><strong>Public Key:</strong> The public portion of your key pair</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>🔑 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</h2>
            <p>PKI is the framework that manages digital certificates and public-key encryption. It consists of:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Certificate Authority (CA):</strong> Trusted entity that issues certificates</li>
                <li><strong>Registration Authority (RA):</strong> Verifies the identity of certificate requesters</li>
                <li><strong>Certificate Database:</strong> Stores issued certificates and their status</li>
                <li><strong>Certificate Policy:</strong> Rules governing certificate usage</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>⚠️ Important:</strong> Your private key must be kept secret and secure. Never share it or transmit it over insecure channels. If compromised, your entire security is at risk.
            </div>
            
            <h2>🛡️ Types of Certificates</h2>
            
            <h3>1. SSL/TLS Certificates</h3>
            <p>Used to secure websites and enable HTTPS. They encrypt data in transit between a client and server.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Client Certificates (mTLS)</h3>
            <p>Used for mutual authentication where both the client and server verify each other's identity. Common in API authentication and secure corporate networks.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Code Signing Certificates</h3>
            <p>Used to digitally sign software and code, proving the publisher's identity and ensuring the code hasn't been tampered with.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Email Certificates (S/MIME)</h3>
            <p>Used to encrypt and digitally sign emails, ensuring confidentiality and authenticity.</p>
            
            <h2>📝 Certificate File Formats</h2>
            
            <h3>Common Formats:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>PEM (.pem, .crt, .cer, .key):</strong> Base64 encoded text format, human-readable. Most common format for Linux/Unix systems.</li>
                <li><strong>DER (.der, .cer):</strong> Binary format of PEM. Used mainly in Java environments.</li>
                <li><strong>PFX/PKCS#12 (.pfx, .p12):</strong> Binary format that can contain both certificate and private key. Password-protected. Common on Windows.</li>
                <li><strong>PKCS#7 (.p7b, .p7c):</strong> Container format for certificates only, no private key. Often used for certificate chains.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="success-box">
                <strong>✅ Best Practice:</strong> Use PEM format for web servers and API services. Use PFX format when importing into Windows systems or when you need a single file with password protection.
            </div>
            
            <h2>🔄 Certificate Lifecycle</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Generation</h3>
            <p>Create a private key and CSR with the necessary information about your organization and domain.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Validation</h3>
            <p>The Certificate Authority validates your organization's identity and domain ownership.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Issuance</h3>
            <p>Once validated, the CA signs your certificate and issues it to you.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Deployment</h3>
            <p>Install the certificate on your server or application along with the private key.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Renewal</h3>
            <p>Certificates have expiration dates. Monitor and renew them before they expire to avoid service disruption.</p>
            
            <h3>6. Revocation</h3>
            <p>If a certificate is compromised or no longer needed, it should be revoked before expiration.</p>
            
            <h2>🔧 Using This Application</h2>
            
            <h3>Generate CSR</h3>
            <p>Create a Certificate Signing Request and private key for your SSL/TLS or client certificate needs. This is typically the first step in obtaining a certificate.</p>
            
            <h3>Sign CSR</h3>
            <p>If you're operating your own CA (for internal use), you can sign CSRs to create certificates. This is common in enterprise environments for internal services.</p>
            
            <h3>Convert Formats</h3>
            <p>Convert between PEM and PFX formats depending on your deployment requirements. PEM is ideal for Linux servers, while PFX is preferred for Windows environments.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>💡 Tip:</strong> For production environments, always use certificates from trusted public CAs. Self-signed certificates should only be used for testing or internal applications.

                <strong>⚠️ Security Reminder:</strong>
                <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li>Always keep your private keys secure and never share them</li>
                    <li>Use strong passwords for PFX files</li>
                    <li>Monitor certificate expiration dates and renew proactively</li>
                    <li>Use at least 2048-bit RSA keys (4096-bit recommended for high-security environments)</li>
                    <li>Revoke certificates immediately if you suspect a compromise</li>
